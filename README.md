### Tension Timer

Tension Timer requires [Simple Calendar by vigoren](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar#installing-the-module); Simple Calendar is not a dependency so needs to be installed and activated separately.  
Setting a Tension Timer will lead to a die being dropped in regular intervals based on the in game clock.

To set a timer open the timer configure using the scene controls.  
Pick the interval you wish to use in _in game_ seconds (default: 600).  
Hit start timer and the Tension Timer will automatically drop dice as appropriate.
The simple calendar must be running for dice to drop.
